I was disappointed in the service.  I made reservations 2 months ahead of time for 5 pm for a party of 6.  They sent us to the 'back room' which consisted of 8 large round tables and the room lacked the ambiance that I wanted when I originally chose this restaurant.  I felt I was being seated at the children's table. I could have selected any restaurant to have eaten in a large back room but the reason I selected this one was for the experience in the main dining room.

Then upon entering the back room, the hostess and waitress debated which table we were to be seated at while we stood there for 5 minutes.  It was very unprofessional and embarrassing, especially since all of the tables were empty.",898,"Harris Steakhouse.

We ordered the turnips as an appetizer.  Nowhere on the menu or description did it mention that half of the dish was meat, and that the turnips were more of an accompaniment.  This was particularly unfortunate because my guest didnt eat meat.  Also, when we ordered our dinner we also ordered a small pizza to go.  We made the order at that time to ensure it would be ready when we were ready to leave.  When our check came, the pizza to go was not listed, nor was it ready.  The waiter blamed the timing on the new chef, but it seemed to me that the error was likely on his end since it wasnt on the check originally, and also for the fact that the restaurant was only half full at the peak of the evening.

As the title says, the food here is great.  We had escargot and a lobster tail as an appetizer, which were perfectly prepared.  For our meals, we had the stuffed prawns and the salmon.  The salmon was phenomenal and was prepared perfectly.  You could cut it like butter.  The prawns were a little over seasoned with garlic for my taste, but still a very good option.  If you are just wanting an honest food review, I would tell you that it is great seafood, but now for what should give you pause ...

The Bad:

We arrived at 7 pm for our reservation on a Saturday night and were immediately seated.  The restaurant was about 3/4 full at best and the bar was empty.  The table we were sat at was in the front of the restaurant between the window and the door so we were forced us to sit next to each other rather than across from one another.  This was not a big deal as it just made for an interesting dining experience.  We were immediately asked if we wanted water.  However, it took 15 minutes for the water to arrive.  When it did arrive, we put in our order and asked for bread, since we had no idea how long it would take as we overheard others joking about how long it was taking to receive their food.  

Could it really be that bad? Yes. Despite putting in our appetizer and food order in at approximately 7:15, the appetizers did not arrive until 8:15 (we checked our watches) and the food until after 8:40. Yes, that was an hour wait for the apps and nearly an hour and a half wait for our food.  In that time, we witnessed one other table get their complete meal (including dessert) despite being sat after us and another table that was sat before us still waiting on their meals.  We also witnessed three couples get up and leave before their orders were ever taken because they waited so long.  It was so bad that the tables were joking with one another about the poor service.  

So, if you can stand bad service, then I would recommend this place for their food.",1990,"Great Food, but horrible service",1169,2.0,http://www.opentable.com/hyde-street-seafood-house-and-raw-bar?rid=1169&tab=2&page=1

Both had lots of seafood: mine in a pesto cream sauce which masked the flavors a bit, and hers in a yummy risotto cooked just right, nice and creamy. The last time we went she got the same dish and asked for no calamari (as she did this time also). The waitress the last time told her she could have extra of what ever other meat was in it so she go extra mussels. This time she asked the waiter if she could have extra mussels to which he said yes. However she did not get the extra. That was disappointing.

They have a different selection of nigiri/sashimi than some other places, e.g. several different kinds of tuna and mackerel and that was nice.  I sat at the sushi bar, and like every other place, the seats and bar were a little too low to actually watch what they are doing, which is always a bit disappointing (but again every place is like this).  The age-dashi-dofu was very good, perfectly cooked, but the miso soup was only average.  The nigiri is $4.50-$7.00 per small piece, so pretty pricy.  The Ozumo roll was very good, but would have been better if cut into one or two more piece (i.e. they were a little large for one bite each).  A bit more pickled ginger with each dish would have been good  Service was a little slow, but I was in no hurry so that wasn't an issue.  They have a very large drink/sake selection, but I just had a Sapporo draft.  Total for miso soup, age-dashi-dofu, 2 small pieces maguro, 2 small pieces hamachi, Ozumo roll and 2 draft Sapporo's + tax & tip was $75.

They did not disappoint. Other than a slight wait for our booked table, the whole experience was fantastic. Luckily, as I was wearing my 'date night heels', the lovely maitre d' located a bar stool for me in the corner. The new location on Brannan has a bit of a bustling NYC brasserie feel to it (including the noise level). 

While we waited, a waiter brought us our drinks and some of their heavenly brussels sprouts chips. Even if you think you don't like brussels sprouts, do yourself a favor and try these crisp lemony delights. You will thank me.

We were seated in a short time and our server was friendly and efficient. The kitchen split our dishes onto separate plates without asking (I never ask so it was a nice surprise - no jockeying with hubby for that last bite). 

We started with the mushroom soup which was one of the best I have had. Very earthy and rich, with a dollop of creme fraiche on top and a gougere on each plate. I wanted to lick my bowl...(but I didn't). Next, we had the little gem salad with a citrusy dressing and crisp vegetables beautifully arranged on the plate. Definitely not your average green salad. For our main, we split the smoked black cod. The fish was flaky and moist and was accompanied by grilled vegetables, wild rice and artichoke something. Great blend of textures and flavors. And the folks sitting at the next table took one look at our side dish of the smoky baked cauliflower (which is covered in provolone and smoked cheddar) and ordered it. 

The wines by the glass and beer list offers a nice assortment of wines for the cuisine. The sommelier was attentive and helpful. Overall, a really solid dining experience. We will be back. 

p.s. Street parking was easy on a Friday night but there is also parking at the Bank of America parking lot. Big plus if you are driving to this South of Market location.",1987,"Delicious food, great service",15424,4.0,http://www.opentable.com/marlowe?rid=15424&tab=2&page=2

There were three of us and the waitress told us it was too light, so we added a branzino main course. The chicken was more than enough for 4 people - when we asked afterwards we were told it a 3lb chicken. While the branzino was cooked to perfection, we ended up taking bags of extra food home. We split a chocolate dessert with a hint of ginger, excellent.",734,"Beautiful room, good food",159247,4.0,http://www.opentable.com/mourad?rid=159247&tab=2&page=1

We also ordered the fried egg salad, grilled pork, grilled chicken, lao sausage, thai som tum and sticky rice. We were not asked how many sticky rices we wanted or how small the portions were for five people, so we had to add on to our order after the fact.

Nearly all the dishes are extremely busy -- they need at least two ingredients removed, and in some cases four.  None of the flavors come through, as a result; it's just a big mix of savory (and that means that dishes have a tendency to taste roughly the same).  And plating!  Everything we ordered looked like a compost heap.

There's only one dessert on offer, which is a missed opportunity.  Because one of our party doesn't like dates (it was date pudding), we went elsewhere for dessert, and the table next to us decided to forego dessert for the same reason.  I know it's an intimate neighborhood venue, but having no choices at all for dessert means not selling more drinks too.

Service wanted to be good, but the servers seemed untrained.

Wine list is excellent .  It's worth going for drinks, and maybe their ""fries"" (which are potato wedges -- that ticked off one of our party).

For my entree, I couldn't NOT order the hamburger and most certainly didn't regret it. I can see why it's so well known.

For years we had our weekly neighborhood ""go-to"" sushi place RocketFish which was awesome! 

We received a birthday roll promotion in the mail a few weeks ago and decide to give Live Sushi another chance especially since RocketFish closed. Well, we were so glad we did! Our lunch sushi was excellent and service great. We decide to go back this week and again the sushi was incredible, creative and fresh!

No Burgundy no Barolo no CNP, not even a token representative of these regions... I settled for the Sea Smoke Pinot Noir which by the way was very nice...
With the high volume The House is still doing it's time to invest in a Sommelier and after all if there is a full bar there should be a full wine list.

We received a birthday roll promotion in the mail a few weeks ago and decide to give Live Sushi another chance especially since RocketFish closed. Well, we were so glad we did! Our lunch sushi was excellent and service great. We decide to go back this week and again the sushi was incredible, creative and fresh!

The other empty tables were reserved by some other privileged absent customers. This made us feel undeserving and we had to wait until 8:30pm at the bar to get a descent table. Our reservation was at 8:00pm.

The cocktail prices did not seem out of line here, but I  didn't find any appealing seasonal cocktails. Once the ingredient list exceeds four items, the bar is gilding the lily as far as I 'm concerned.  We found a couple of good bottles of wine, but the wine list seemed generally overpriced. 
I have to say our food was tasty, but the care in the kitchen did not extend to the service. Our small, cold plates arrived after the substantial warm dishes. The waitress warned us that the dishes ""do not come out of the kitchen in any particular order."" She was certainly right, and I can't blame her or the other servers for this inherently flawed concept of food service.
But while I am grousing about the service, I will also vent about ""small plates."" I don't understand why servers are trained to describe small plates as ""sharable"" if the food doesn't come served as finger food on tooth picks or cut into bite size pieces. The servers should just offer to bring extra silverware and plates if a guest inquires about dividing a serving.
So if you like overwrought cocktails and overpriced wine, this might be the place for you.  If you also like flavorful, innovative food and don't mind if it is served haphazardly, you will surely enjoy this place. The eardrum-battering music also adds spice to the atmosphere and makes it easy to avoid conversing with your guests.

The food was very good which made the wait and frustration of driving into the North end worth it. Try the crispy calamari and excellent home made mozzarella tomato salad for starters.

Our entrees disappointed a bit. My husband got the Marsala, nice size portion and looked delicious. But he said it had a strong lemon flavor that wasn't pleasant. Almost as if someone thought it was supposed to be picatta. That was a bummer. I got the chicken cannellone. The flavors were really good, it was just pretty rich for me. I only ate half.

The dessert was delicious! We shared the pomegranate chocolate chip gelato. They make it in house, please try it! :)

2) Three diners ordered Pork and 5 ordered beef. The pork had a charred top which negated the taste of the pork, because it was overwhelmed by the burnt carbon taste. On the other hand, all 5 beef dishes were complimented as tasting great.

This was fine, although not what we had planned and primed ourselves for. The entree choices included butter-poached monkfish, lamb, squab and a vegetarian choice. All a bit heavy for noon.

The service was lovely, and food carefully prepared. We were shocked at the price - $98 per person - which was mentioned nowhere on the website or the menu that day. ""If you have to ask...""

It was lovely but a bit disappointing.",731,We stumbled upon Seasons searching,2989,5.0,http://www.opentable.com/mkt-restaurant-and-bar?rid=2989&tab=2&page=14

I had the risotto cakes, and they were seriously to die for. Everything on everyone's plate looked and tasted phenomenal!!

Wait staff should have confidence in their chefs, not make me wonder why they're asking about my food.

How can you not just love a good parent with limited child time who spends it properly. The trade off ? A long weekend with his son...very cool.

Pozole is a hominy soup with pork base and usually includes a variety of bits to add as you like -- including cabbage, radishes, fried tortillas, peppers and other vegetables.

I ordered the gnocci with duck ragu. The gnocci was big and doughy. The sauce was very rich and heavy, and overpowering.

 At the restaurant, we were greeted warmly and lead to a table by a window which was exactly what we were hoping for, but I believe there is not one table that you could sit and not enjoy the spectacular view.
We started with a Bloody Mary with just the correct amount of heat made from their own house Bloody Mary mix, dressed with their own marinated olives and chiles, and accompanied by a long celery stick. ""It was like having an appetizer!"" 
Next, my friend ordered the artichoke bisque soup and I ordered a salad perfectly dressed with a vinaigrette dressing. Both were beautifully presented and made with fresh locally grown greens and fall vegetables.
For our entrees, my friend had the dungeonus crab-cakes, that looked wonderful, and I had the pan seared scallops with prawn scampi on a bed of Israeli couscous that was simply delicious! We were too full for dessert but I have no doubt that it would have been as equally satisfying.

I thought it was the best Italian I had found in San Francisco (most comparable to my favorite places in NYC) - and raved about it to my friends.
I couldn't wait to bring my boyfriend for his birthday, but could not have been more let down. We ordered the special truffle, egg and ricotta ravioli dish that was bland (the first time I've had truffle anything that could be described as 'bland'"") and not well balanced. We didn't even finish it and it was our least favorite of all. The rest of our meal was mediocre at best. I am not sure if we just ordered wrong or were there on an off night, but we will not be returning.
For mediocre food I felt it was also overpriced, 2 appetizers, 2 pasta primis, 1 dessert and an average bottle of wine came to $300; I have had much, much better meals in this range.

1 menber in our party ordered a cocktail (Gingy I think) and did not care for it. The waitress politely replaced it wtih a Strawberry Fields which I had ordered. It came back a light lemony yellow color and was different than mine. The waitress just said, ""oh,

Two appetizers, while tasty, arrived in what we both agreed were comically small portions, especially considering the price. Entrees (swordfish and pork chops) were both quite flavorful, though not showstoppers. The one exceptional item was a dessert, cheesecake broul, which -- as we were properly warned -- looks nothing like a cheescake.

But it was hard to enjoy any of the food, because the place was so RIDICULOUSLY loud. We were upstairs, at almost the absolute furthest point from the piano and singer, but still could barely hear each other speak. This was a weeknight and well after the peak dinner hour, so the place wasn't anywhere near capacity. I'd hate to think what it's like on a packed Saturday.

My guest was so put off by this person's behavior and constant interruption and edginess, that she didn't finish her meal and we left early.  He hovered constantly, his command of English was poor, so we didn't understand what he was asking us, he didn't know our orders, but brought the food and couldn't figure out who to give it to, and grunted at us when we didn't understand what he was doing.  We had to constantly check in with our waiter to ask what was going on and to clarify our orders.  This person dashed around the very small space and in between our table and the counter so often it was truly disruptive.  He also darted in and out of the restaurant.

I didn't try any of the meat dishes but my companions did and thier one comment was that if you add ham to the mac and cheese is it really necessary to add bacon to the green beans served with it, or maybe not so much bacon.

The menu focuses on fresh, locally sourced ingredients. Most appetizers and desserts are under under $10 and entrees in the $20s, but I ordered from the ""Neighborhood Menu""...a starter, main, and dessert for $37. Not bad. I picked the Cauliflower soup, Braised Lamb Shoulder (normally a separate menu item, but added to the set menu during their last few weeks) and Vanilla Cheesecake. 

All of them were good, but OMG the Lamb Shoulder...it's up there with the best lamb I've had.

We were the first and then followed 3-4 other couples and we were all frustrated. The restaurant wasnt even crowded and there were tables but they just left us standing. After a very bad beginning, we were served a supposedly 4 course menu which we thought included the wine/champagne but no it had to be billed separately. The food was just average and very very little in quantity. And as usual an enormous amount of dinner was just  in waiting for the dishes. I really didnt know what they were thinking. We paid a whoomping 187$ for the dinner and it was so not worth even half the money.

No decent Chardonnay (only two on the list, one of which they didn't have), and only two Cabernet Sauv's, one of which was $210.

-The ambiance at John's was fun
-The service was attentive (didn't have to wait for more water or to pour wine)

Negatives:
-Our steaks (all three) were way overcooked! Everyone in my group ordered medium-rare and we all commented on how ""not remotely pink"" the center of the meat was. I am not one to complain often about a meal but it really ruined a much anticipated steak meal. At a steak restaurant, I feel that cooking the meat to specifications is the one thing you should always do right.

Clientele was very mature...we felt like we were in a nice nursing home dining hall.  This was the first clue that our meal would not be good.

The meal started with carrot soup, which was on par with something you would get at a cafeteria.  Next course we both ordered a spinach salad with Gorgonzola cheese which was actually warm (and not on purpose).  I could not eat it.  The worst part of all was the main course. I had ordered a chicken with prosciutto and swiss.  I took one bite and could not eat any more. My husband, seeing that I did not like it, switched with me. He had the mushroom risotto, which I unfortunately did not like it either. Since my husband could not eat the chicken either I gave him back the risotto. 

Surprisingly, the woman who came to take my plate did not ask if I did not care for my meal as I clearly did not eat any of my food.  Nor did she ask if I wanted to wrap it (my entire food minus 2 tastes was still on my plate).

For dessert, there was a choice of a chocolate trio or raspberry creme brulee. We both opted for chocolate trio, which was presented very nicely; however, the presentation was deceiving. One item was a white gelatin which we could not figure out what it was  The moose was watery and tasted like hospital food.  The heart shaped chocolate cake tasted like a Tasty Cake. 

We did order a bottle of BV Cabernet.  It came very warm and was not drinkable until we  put it in a ice bucket for 30 minutes.

Sadly, this evening was a major let-down.  I was very upset to pay almost $200 for a meal I could not even eat. I would never go back and am very annoyed that we wasted all that money on an inedible meal.",1859,Never Again,4633,2.0,http://www.opentable.com/lolivier?rid=4633&tab=2&page=1

There is also a nice outdoor seating area, but it was not being utilized for New Year's Eve. The patio would be great fun on a warmer San Francisco Evening.

For dinner they have 2 set menus to choose from, where you pick your entree and the rest (soup, starters, bread, dessert, etc) is standard for everyone. Although the food was decent, I was disappointed with the lack of authenticity, and the flavors were way too tame for Moroccan food. The starters (mezze style) tasted nice (they were probably the closest to what I expect in terms of seasoning) and the chicken bastela (stuffed filo pastry) was perfectly crispy but unfortunately lacked seasoning. For main I had the chicken with prunes. It was not bad but seriously lacked flavor and came on its own on a sad white plate whereas I expected it to be served in a tajine with some couscous or at least some garnish. I would gladly have just eaten the prunes stew which tasted good but unfortunately there was only a tiny quantity accompanying the chicken (which by the way is 2 thighs so served on the bone, good to know if you don't like anything that's not boneless). My boyfriend had the chicken and lamb kobab which was ok but again was sad looking on a white plate with a tiny serving of couscous (this is Moroccan food, couscous need to be served in mounds!) and a few veggies, nothing to remember. The service was friendly but because everyone in the room gets the same dishes except for the entrees, they forgot a couple times which step we were at (""have you had your soup already?"" - Yes we have. ""Have you had your bastela already?"" - No we haven't, etc), not a big deal but not super pro.
