This was particularly unfortunate because my guest didnt eat meat.  Also, when we ordered our dinner we also ordered a small pizza to go.  We made the order at that time to ensure it would be ready when we were ready to leave.  When our check came, the pizza to go was not listed, nor was it ready.  The waiter blamed the timing on the new chef, but it seemed to me that the error was likely on his end since it wasnt on the check originally, and also for the fact that the restaurant was only half full at the peak of the evening.

Icon perhaps, great food not so much.
We sat down to be served by David although it was a change of shift so our new server would be Andrew. We ordered the Hot Sampler trio that was good though not necessarily worth the $29.00 price tag for our entrees we ordered the Pasta Diplomatica with a marinara base, good flavor yet seemed to be no clams. Also ordered the roasted beet salad with a side of the brussel sprouts & crispy pancetta plus the child's marinara spaghetti. The brussel sprouts didn't seem to be thoroughly cooked and the pancetta seemed to be bacon neither of which were crispy. Pretty sure we could have done a better job at  home and the flavor of the food was lacking as it had an undertone of metal to it.
Andrew was pleasant although annoying at the same time, he was constantly standing over us or talking to us about our baby not letting us enjoy a peaceful meal.

All the beef is well aged.  We all had different degrees  of doneness.  Each one was perfect.  There are no fancy sauces poured over the top.  Just great tasting, tender meat.  Each menu selection comes with a side dish.  My favorite, by far, is the Cream Spinach.  It is spinach with a light cream sauce that is delicious but not heavy.  We all had the Caesar Salad, which is not to big or too garlicky.  The Martini's are some of the best
